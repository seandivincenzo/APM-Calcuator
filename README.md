# FAQ

## What is this?
APM Calculator was a tool created during the hight of the APM craze in Monopoly GO! in order to easily track rolls without the need of pen and paper.

## How does it work?
APM Calculator takes inputs from the user and creates a list of what rolls the player has made, the board tracker allows the user to select a starting space and visualize the next two rolls.
You can see it in action here: https://ecd9f3ff.goapmcalculator.pages.dev/

## Is APM cheating?
APM or Airplane Mode, is an exploit for the mobile game Monopoly GO! that allows players to manipulate their device's airplane mode to get the most out of their rolls. It is 100% cheating. Please don't cheat.

## Does this Calculator cheat for me?
**No,** this calculator is simply a tool to track rolls, it does not modify or engage directly with the game itself.

## Why did you release this source code?
I no longer had the time or money to continue the development of the calculator and keep the domain running. I am releasing the source code to "pass the torch" so to speak.

## If I use your code do I need to credit you?
Yes, if you use my code you **must** credit me and link to this github, even if you change the code. If you do take over the project I also request you join the existing [APM Calculator Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/jPdmaFSAC2) as the new developer,
